 It seems like you write stuff in the www folder and when you type in 'phonegap build ios' it recreates everything int eh phonegap/platforms/ios folder (David confirmed that in the older version of phone gap you'd have to point the folders to one directory, now it just rebuilds from the www directory).

Really good resource for new phonegap3.0 stuff http://phonegap-tips.com/articles/installing-plugins-with-phonegaps-command-line-interface.html.
